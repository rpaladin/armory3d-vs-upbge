    <td>Being a fork of Blender's former Game Engine, UPBGE has a good and semi-long history of making AAA quality games<br />However, performance has always been one of the major negatives surrounding, thus preventing it for professional usage in the long term<br />This doesn't mean it's not bad for short-term, personal projects however!!</td>
